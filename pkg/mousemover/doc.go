/*
Ever felt the need to keep your machine awake without having to resort to the age-old
methods of installing an app that you don't trust or playing a video? Well, not anymore!

Introducing the simplest app on the market that has the sole purpose of moving your mouse
pointer at regular intervals so that your machine never sleeps! And best of all, it works
ONLY when you are not working, so be rest assured that the mouse won't start moving on its
own without the machine actually being idle.

# Installation

The library can be installed using:

	go get -u github.com/automatic-mouse-mover/pkg/mousemover

# Usage

Clone this repo and run Make, it should create the amm.app and open the folder where
it was built for you. You just have to drag and drop it to the Applications folder on your mac.

Refer to the README for more details.
